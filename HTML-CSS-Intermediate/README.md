HTML is an incredibly useful skill for bloggers, content creators, email marketers, small business owners, designers; it is absolutely necessary for front-end web developers.

In this workshop, you'll learn HTML, the language used by the billions of webpages out there today to mark up content. The comprehensive workshop will be a mix of lectures, pair programming, and hands-on exercises building your webpage.

You'll get hands-on experience working with HTML5 features like semantic elements and forms, and you'll learn new CSS3 properties and abilities including multi column layout using Flexbox and Grid. Finally, we'll dig into responsive design.

You'll leave with readily-applicable skills and we'll be there to answer any questions you may have along the way!
