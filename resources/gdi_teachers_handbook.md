**Big thank you for being an instructor with Girl Develop It! Instructors are a huge part of our mission to empower women with hands-on web and software development workshops.  The information below is designed to help make your class a success.  If you have never taught before, or it’s your first time teaching for GDI,  please see our Instructor Training Guide.**

## The Girl Develop It Instructor
As a GDI instructor, you will not only be teaching hands-on tech skills… you will be a huge part of how we empower students to succeed in their lives and careers. At GDI, we do that three ways:

* Reject stereotypes
Women grow up with so many stereotypes, especially when it comes to technology. At GDI, we invert the norm and make women the majority. (All genders are welcome, but we focus on women.) The GDI workshops that you teach are a chance for students to see women leading, organizing, and learning.

* Lower the barriers to entry
At  GDI, we offer personal instruction at a low cost and publish the materials online for free. We also make sure that students maximize their learning by making sure that each class has hands-on exercises.

* Cultivate an inclusive environment
All questions are okay, and the only way to learn is to take risks. We encourage students to take risks, ask questions, and try things that they may not be good at... yet. Everybody has to start somewhere. It’s not just about students “acing” the class – we don’t give grades or judge them. Instead, it’s about using their time with you to learn something new.

## Instructor Responsibilities
As a instructor, you are a huge part of Girl Develop It’s mission to create a network of empowered women who feel confident in their abilities to code.  By teaching women around the world from diverse backgrounds to learn software development, we can help women improve their careers and confidence in their everyday lives. We believe that women are interested and capable of learning to code, and we prove it through our workshops.

Your responsibility as a instructor is first and foremost to **create an empowering workshop experience**. Be professional and prepared. Also, remember that learning isn’t just about receiving information or completing an exercise. Students want to be **inspired**.

As a instructor, we also want you to **collaborate with the organizers**. GDI HQ and your Chapter Leaders are here to help you plan and execute your workshop smoothly, and there are specific things they’ll ask you to do (all of which are outlined in this doc). **Consistency** is a huge factor in building trust with our students, and many of these activities are designed to ensure specific student outcomes.

**Pay it forward**. Once you’ve taught a few classes and know the ropes, become a leader. Help us improve the online teaching materials in a way that’s going to help the next instructor. Give us feedback on how we can improve the student experience. Help new instructors find their way. With your help, this organization will be continuing to empower students for a long time after you’ve taught your last class with us.
