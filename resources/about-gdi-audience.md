# GDI Audience
---

Girl Develop it offers affordable programs for adult women interested in learning web and software development in a judgment-free environment.

Most of our audience is women that are tangentially involved in web development. That may mean:

  * They work in other areas of software development or are Computer Science students and want to learn more about web development or another type of language or technologies.
  * They are working at a startup and want to learn more about what their colleagues do.
  * They are looking to transition from a non-technical role into web development and teaching themselves it.
  * They want to learn a new technology or language to feel more empowered and confident in their abilities to code.
  * They ant to improve their coding careers and confidence in their work environment.
  * They are seeking professional help software development and create basic to advanced web and mobile applications.
  * They are looking to network opportunities and to meet other women in tech.


Generally, we try to teach to the more newbie crowd, and we cater to more advanced segment of the crowd via “bonuses” in the exercises or providing a program or workshop for a more specific advance technology.

Some advices from previous chapter leaders and teachers:

* When we're not sure the topic breakdown to cover for a topic, we sometimes ask questions when they RSVP and use that to guide the content. We can ask them about their prior experience with related technologies, and ask them what they hope to do with the knowledge from the workshop.

* We can also specify a set of prerequisites for a workshop, but beware that if the prerequisites are very advanced, then we will not have as many members eligible to attend.
