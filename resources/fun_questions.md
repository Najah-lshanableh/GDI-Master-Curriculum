For our workshops, we often like to start off with both round-the-room introductions and person-next-to-you introductions, to give people more starting points for conversation.

## During round-the-room introductions:
* What would you want to find at the end of a rainbow?
* If you could be half one animal and half another animal, what would the combo be?
* What’s your favorite outdoor activity?
* What’s the weirdest thing you’ve eaten?
* What’s a recent book you’ve read and loved?
* What was your favorite TV show or book series as a kid?
* If you could be any character from a TV/movie/book, who would you be?
* What’s something that you did this year that you’re proud of?
* What’s your favorite HTML tag and why?
* What’s your favorite CSS property and why?
* What’s your favorite native JavaScript function and why?
* What would you want to be the mascot of a sports team?


## For pairs to ask each other (answers should be a bit longer):
* What was the last trip you took?
* What was the last thing you learned, besides coding?
* What are you most excited about this summer/fall/winter/spring?
* What was the most exciting thing you did in the last 6 months?
