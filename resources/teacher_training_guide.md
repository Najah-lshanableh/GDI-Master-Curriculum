## Before you teach

### Observe or TA a workshop
Make sure you understand the GDI values, how workshops operate, and what students expect when they come to a workshop. Consistency is important for building trust with our students and creating a positive learning environment. Your workshop will need to be consistent with the other workshops offered through GDI. We require all instructors to TA at least two classes before teaching so you can have a good idea how our classes run and know what to expect.
